      <h2>Skills & Projects</h2>
      <p>
        The first language I have learned is Python. Using TkInter an pygame I made a couple of small games but nothing
        github worthy. After that I learned the basics of C and I am currently learning C++ for the programming
        tournament.<br>
        My favourite language by far is Rust. I have learned to code in Rust this Summer and I am shocked by it's
        capabilities. I made a couple of programs using Rust that fix holes in my Arch Linux OS. I have tried making a
        backend using Rocket but have abandoned it because of school.<br>
        I now know HTML/CSS because of the NIT course mentioned earlier. In the next 6 months I will learn JavaScript
        and React.js. All the code I write for the course is avalaible on my github linked below.
